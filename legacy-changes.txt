All API requests were moved to a dedicated API service (original implementation had all API calls in the Search component).
Front-end variables were renamed to be more semantic, and the logic flow was improved to enhance readability and to ensure each component was pure.
The server and front-end was refactored to be in TypeScript.
Added the ability to refresh the retrieved playlist in the case the user wanted to get a new one for the same artist.
Added the ability to save the current playlist to a database.
Added the ability to browse saved playlists (original implementation was hard-coded and not actually parsing the database).
Added a landing page to display a message if the front-end cannot connect to the server (included adding some error handling in the server).
